#Dull Facebook

**Dull Facebook** is Chrome Extension MVP that reduces your use of Facebook. It blocks features that some users find unhealthy or unproductive.

 - Removes the newsfeed from Facebook, reducing cognitive overload and
   social comparison. The goal is to break your habit of overspending
   time and attention scrolling through endless overwhelming, irrelevant
   content.

 - Removes blue branding from Facebook. The goal is to
   disassociate Facebook's brand from your cognitive and emotional
   experience, making you less likely to experience brand attachment.

 - Removes all color from Facebook and displays grayscale shading
   instead. The goal is to prevent colors and enticing images from
   engaging you, while text and navigation remains readable.

*Soon, the extension will replace Facebook's negative features with positive, wholesome experiences, renamed as Heartbook.*
