      <h2 class="question">How might you and I design simple, productive micro-experiences for humans online so that they enjoy more quality time offline?</h2>
      <h4>It's my mission to answer that question with you</h4>
      <p>A primary issue with addictive smartphones and social media is that they’re designed to maximize engagement. Widespread, heavy usage of these tools is a only recent experiment, starting with the iPhone’s initial release in 2007. Early indications show that human health is taking a significant hit in various forms. Typical users of these technologies are acquiring a new array of social, physical, emotional and cognitive health issues. We’re becoming increasingly insecure, dumber, fatter, and less able to focus and read. </p>
      <!-- <p>The root source of engagement-driven design involves <em class="">usage-driven business models</em>, which is common when businesses rely on advertising and consumption. Facebook and Netflix are prime examples. In fact, the CEO of Netflix considers his own customers' sleep as their business's stiffest compitition.</p>
      <blockquote>
        Sometimes employees at Netflix think, ‘Oh my god, we’re competing with FX, HBO, or Amazon,” said Hastings, “but think about if you didn’t watch Netflix last night: What did you do? There’s such a broad range of things that you did to relax and unwind, hang out, and connect — and we compete with all of that.” … “You get a show or a movie you’re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,” he said of his No. 1 competitor. Not that he puts too much stock in his rival: “And we’re winning!”

      <p>The root source of engagement-driven design involves <em class="">usage-driven business models</em>, which is common when businesses rely on advertising and consumption. However, now is best time for startups to shift towards <em class="green-highlight">human experience-first models</em>. This approach aligns with the philosophy that <strong>long-term gains and relationships are sustainable when customers’ full 24-hour contexts and well-being are prioritized.</strong></p>
      <p>Designers and entrepenuers have the opportunity to create products that help people engage with experiences that truly matter: our offline, quality time spent with friends, family and the environment. How can we design tools that reduce our time online, so we spend more time <em>living</em>?</p>
