      <h4>Featured Work</h4>
      <h1><strong>Hostelhops</strong> Reception App</h1>
      <p>Hostelhops helps backpackers book with tour guides. Traditional booking methods are slow, frustrating and unreliable. So we created an app that makes bookings easier, faster and more abundant. It was the first of its kind to succeed in Latin America without VC funding.</p>

      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>A small startup, Open Travel Exchange, attempted to build a marketplace for 5 years. They experimented in the lower-end tourism market, focusing on hostels, tour operators and shuttles. The founders hired me as their first employee to solve various design problems.
      </p>

      <h4>The Challenge</h4>
      <p>Build a new marketplace app that facilities tourism bookings between 3 user roles. Overcome the complexities of 3-sided marketplaces so that all 3 roles activate simultaneously.  Do this with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Small budget</strong> <em>$2000</em></li>
        <li><strong>Short runway</strong> <em>6 months</em></li>
        <li><strong>Small team</strong> <em>8 people</em></li>
      </ul>

      <h4>My Role</h4>
      <p>I was the first employee, <strong>only designer</strong> and wearer of many hats. For this project, I lead the following tasks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User Research</li>
        <li><strong>UX &amp; UI Design</strong> <em>Core focus</em></li>
        <li>Front-End Dev</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="col col-sm-12 complex-challenge">
      <p>Standard marketplaces require two sides (supply and demand) to activate in concurrence. My assignment, a three-sided marketplace, has an added dimension of complexity (agent). It requires an additional role to activate at the exact moment the other two do. And that extra dimension is makes the success rate of three-sided marketplaces low.</p>
      <blockquote>Don't do it. It's too hard.</blockquote>
      <cite>CEO of Postmates, Bastian Lehmann <sup><a href="#source-1">1</a></sup></cite>
      <p>But we like challenges. So our team of industry misfits took on the challenge without VC-funding, ate ramen and, at times, slept on floors. </p>

      <h4>User Discovery</h4>
      <h2>Deeply understanding each user role</h2>
      <p>The challenge first required comprehensive knowledge about our users and their contexts. I needed insights on their backgrounds, goals, pains, resources and limitations.      </p>
      <p>Passively acquiring that data through remote channels may be ineffective. However, living among users would allow me to experience their problems first-hand. And that experience informs a better solution.</p>
      <p>So I moved into a hostel, to learn from our different users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Backpackers </li>
        <li>Hostel receptionists </li>
        <li>Tour guides </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Field Immersion</h3>
      <p>In Panama & Brazil, I stayed in 6 hostels for 90 days, and averaged 20 hours/day (including sleep) embedded the environment of the users.</p>
      <p><em>Because I wake up when users (my "roommates") cough, crawl into bed or open the door, I get to claim that time!</em></p>
      <p>Living and working in their shoes (for 1800 hours!) was vital to gaining deep empathy with our diverse user base. It also provided direct access to users for interviews, surveys and usability tests.</p>
    </section>

    <section class=" col-sm-12 surveys-interviews">
      <h3>Surveys &amp; Interviews</h3>
      <p>I surveyed 200 backpackers to acquire data for scale and interviewed 50 to understand them at depth. Effective techniques for interviews involved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shutting Up &amp; Listening</strong> <em>everyone likes to vent about their problems</em></li>
        <li><strong>5-Whys</strong> <em>continually ask <strong>why?</strong> to dig deeper towards the core problem</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Effective techniques for surveys involved:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Beer</strong> <em>a timeless motivator</em></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class=" col-sm-12 shadowing">
      <h3>Guerrilla Research &amp; Shadowing</h3>
      <p>While joining backpackers on tours, I built relationships with tour guides and observed their process. Perhaps I was the insatiable guy in the passenger seat asking endless questions and ruining your vacation. It was for good reason, I swear!</p>
      <p>And on days that I spent inside the hostels, I shadowed hostel receptionists. Working behind their desks, I acted as the agent in the booking relationship and experienced problems for myself.</p>
      <p>Personally feeling those pain points and struggling through productivity gaps would soon inform the solution's design.</p>

      <h2>Demonstrating insights to teammates</h2>
      <p>Our team included smart individuals with various backgrounds (from Lithuania to Puerto Rico) and disciplines (engineering to customer success).</p>
      <p>Often, we worked remotely. It was paramount for us all to share a common understanding of the users. That foundation of shared knowledge clarified remote communication, reducing misunderstandings.</p>

    <section class="  col-sm-12 personas">
      <h3>User Personas</h3>
      <p>I compiled hundreds of surveys, interviews and field notes into stories and characters. The characters represented common traits among our diverse users.</p>
      <p>60% of our backpackers, for example, spoke English as a second language. That segment accounted for 18 unique native languages!</p>
      <p>Because of significant differences like these, I designed multiple personas for backpackers. That set of various personas is what I now call a persona deck.</p>

      <h3>User Stories</h3>
      <p>I composed stories based on true events. Some I observed in the field. Others sourced from surveys and interviews.</p>
      <p>The stories' problems were commonly rooted in miscommunication and/or slow feedback. So we aligned our focus on those problems.</p>
      <p>My teammates and I referenced the stories in our abstract dialog. In effect, the stories were a team-wide heuristic (or shortcut) that simplified our internal communication.</p>
